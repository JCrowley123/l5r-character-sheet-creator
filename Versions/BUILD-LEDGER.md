# Rokugan Build Ledger

Where every roadmap phase actually stands — separating what is **verified** from what is merely
**built**, and what is built from what is **finished**.

| Interactive version | [Rokugan Build Ledger artifact](https://claude.ai/code/artifact/316b554f-75f0-4c69-a2db-60b27e102f3b) — same content, but the tick-boxes below actually save there |

> **This file is a snapshot; the artifact is the live copy.** Ticking a box in the artifact does

> *what* the phases are; this ledger only tracks *how far along* each one is.

## At a glance

| Status | Count | What it means |
|---|---:|---|
| ✅ **Fully done** | 8 | Built, and proven by something other than an assertion |
| 🔵 **Built, not validated** | 1 | Mechanism works; no evidence from real hardware yet |
| 🟡 **Started, not finished** | 1 | One half shipped, the other half parked |
| ⬜ **Ahead** | 14 | Not started (Phase 10 excluded — deferred by design) |

## ✅ Fully done

Built, and proven by an automated harness with a recorded pass count, a byte-identical build
check, or a real device — not by a claim.

**Phase 0 — Source Reorganization** · Part F
Build output **byte-identical** to the pre-split deliverable; behavioural parity harness across
all 14 flows.
*The current trunk — every later phase edits its fragments.*

**Phase 0.5 — Hosting & Deployment** · Part F
Cloudflare Pages rebuilds and redeploys on every push to `main`; the deploy refuses to publish
if its copy doesn't hash identically to the Phase 0 build.
*Repo stays private; the pages.dev link is open and unauthenticated. Two separate facts, and
only the first is enforced by anything.*

**Phase 0.6 — Installable Web App** · Part F
PWA and update harnesses pass, and — the part that matters — install, launch and aeroplane-mode
offline were all **confirmed on an iPhone 16e**.
*The offline case only passed after a real failure was found on that device and fixed. This is
the one delivery phase with genuine device evidence behind it.*

**Phase 1.5 — Roll Pipeline Consolidation** · Part G
**34/34** checks against the modifier registry, every contributor, and stacked combinations.
No production code changed — audit only.

**Phase 1 — UI/UX Foundations** · Part H
**9/9** against the fixed build, and **4/9** against the build that originally shipped — the
harness was made to fail before it was trusted.
*Shipped broken: the first harness asked the code under test whether it was working, so both
halves agreed with each other rather than with reality. Real-device testing caught it. This is
the origin of the project's "a harness must be able to fail — prove it" rule.*

**Phase 1.6 — Combat Tab Streamlining** · Part H
**23/23** checks, plus a full before/after behavioural diff against the rest of the sheet.

**Phase 2 — Quick-Access Sidebar** · Part H
**19/19**, dropping to 12/19 and 18/19 against two intermediate builds each missing one class of
live-update hook.
*Its own harness caught four controls that bypass `recalcAll()` — three before shipping, and the
shared Bonus-slot pool after a real-device tester noticed it missing.*

**Phase 3 — Smart Roll Preview** · Part G
**35/35** checks, dropping to **18/21** (at the 21 checks that existed then) against a build that
commits the Void spend on toggle instead of on confirm, **7/21** with the phase's kill-switch
off, and **32/35** with the Skill-Rank RAW gate reverted. Phase 1.5's pipeline baseline still
reads 34/34.
*The audit found the roadmap's "introduce a RollContext" already built, so this renders the
pipeline's own numbers rather than computing its own. Ticking a Void option in the preview costs
nothing until you actually roll.*

⚠️ *Real-device testing after ship found **two** genuine rules bugs, both in the Void spend list
and both surfaced by the preview showing that list plainly for the first time.*

*First: ticking two one-roll Void options stacked both onto the same roll — an Earth Ring Roll's
`2k2` went to `4k4`. Root cause was two-fold: "+1 Trait" was never a real RAW power (RAW's actual
text is one `+1k1` effect covering Skill/Trait/Ring/Spell Casting rolls), and nothing enforced
"only one of these effects" outside combat.*

*Second: `+1 Skill Rank (0 → 1)` was offered on every roll kind except Damage — including Ring
rolls, which have no Skill Rank at all. RAW restricts it twice in one sentence ("from 0 to 1",
"avoiding Unskilled Roll penalties"), so it applies to a skill-based roll made unskilled and
nothing else. Reported by the project owner's own reading of the rule, which was correct.*

*Both fixed the same session, in `160-feat-void.js` rather than in the preview — the preview
decides what to offer by simulating the real contributor, so fixing the rule fixed the offer
list with no second copy to maintain. See
`BUGFIX — Void One-Roll Effects Not Mutually Exclusive/README.md`.*

## 🔵 Built, not yet validated

The mechanism is built and its automated side passes. What's missing is evidence from actual
hardware — and this project's own history says that gap is where the bugs live: the first
real-device test found two in an afternoon.

### Phase 0.7 — Native Android App · Part F

Capacitor wrap; the APK compiles in GitHub Actions and the staged page hashes identically to the
website's. None of that proves how a phone behaves.

Full instructions for each test are in
`Part F — Cross-Platform Delivery/PART F — Phase 0.7 Native Android App/qa/MANUAL-TESTS.md`.
Report failures by **test number** and **what you saw**.

- [ ] **1 · It installs** — Android will refuse first and offer a settings link; that's expected
      outside the Play Store. Passes when it appears in the drawer as "L5R Sheet".
- [ ] **2 · Icon and splash look right** — samurai artwork, not a generic robot. All five element
      mons down the left, nothing clipped. Worth noting whether your launcher shows it as a
      circle, squircle or rounded square — the icon is built to survive all three and this is the
      only way to confirm it does.
- [ ] **3 · It fills the screen** — no address bar, nothing identifying it as a web page.
- [ ] **4 · It works with no network** — aeroplane mode, WiFi off, swipe it from recents, reopen.
      Everything is inside the APK, so this should work on the very first launch. If it doesn't,
      that's a real defect.
- [ ] **5 · Characters survive closing the app** — make one, force-close, reopen.
- [ ] **6 · Characters survive an app update** — *the one most likely to fail.* Needs two APKs, an
      earlier and a later build. Install over the top and check your characters are still there.
- [ ] **7 · It survives a reboot** — restart the phone, open the app, characters intact.

## 🟡 Started, not finished

### Phase 9 — Polish & Immersion · Part H

**Built and verified:** Clan-themed UI skins — **14/14** checks, dropping to 13/14 and 9/14
against two scratch builds each missing one thing (a safety-colour protection, and the phase's
own kill-switch). Per-Clan override of the sheet's `--shu*` tokens, plus the ink-brush mon
watermark and tab-bar colophon. Three mockup rounds settled the treatment before any code was
written.

**Outstanding:**

- [ ] **School-specific flavour text** — *desktop session required.* Blocked on source material,
      not effort: the sourcebook PDFs are gitignored and desktop-only. 61 major-clan and 22
      minor-clan schools, none carrying a description field today. Scope measured and four open
      decisions written up in that phase's `DESKTOP-HANDOFF — School Flavour Text.md`.
- [ ] **Void pip should stay grey** — parked feedback. It currently follows the Clan theme, unlike
      the Void ring art and the spell slots, which keep a fixed neutral.
- [ ] **Colophon placement** — parked feedback. Looks odd sitting behind the tab bar and "sort of
      breaks" on the Identity tab; not yet root-caused.
- [ ] **Floating-button clutter** — parked feedback, and an open design question rather than a
      bug: three fixed controls now share a narrow screen and sometimes overlap readable fields.

The three parked items are recorded in full, in your own words, in
`Part H — Sheet UI-UX/PENDING FEEDBACK — Real-Device UX Notes.md`.

## ⬜ Ahead

In Recommended Build Order. **Phase 4 is next** — and Phase 3 reduced it to mostly wiring by
building the shared breakdown renderer it needs.
"Partly built already" is the roadmap's own note that the machinery exists and the phase is
really an audit-and-extend rather than a fresh build.

| Phase | Name | Part | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4 | "Explain This Roll" | G | Partly built already |
| 6 | Kata/Technique Synergy Detection | G | |
| 5 | Character Creation Linting | J | |
| 7 | Data Integrity & Persistence | J | Partly built already |
| 4.5 | Modal-Configured Advantages/Disadvantages | I | |
| 4.6 | Alternate Paths — All Classes | I | Needs sourcebooks |
| 4.7 | Advanced Schools | I | Needs sourcebooks |
| 4.8 | Ancestors | I | Needs sourcebooks — you have this material |
| 8 | "Why Can't I Cast This?" | J | Partly built already |
| 11 | Characters List, Wizard & Save Model | K | |
| 12 | Play Mode / Management Mode Split | K | |
| 13 | Library (Sourcebook Viewer) | K | Needs sourcebooks |
| 14 | Comprehensive Search | K | Needs Phase 13 |
| 15 | UI Consistency Pass | H | Built dead last, by design |

**Phase 10 — Future Expansions (Equipment)** sits outside this count: deferred by design, not yet
assigned a Part, nothing scoped to build.

## Also shipped, outside the phase numbering

**The removability contract.** Phases 1, 2 and 9 were hardened so any one can be surgically
removed without touching the others — guarded hooks, per-phase comment markers, and a
`qa/feature-dependencies.py` check that attributes every reference to whichever phase owns it.
Proven by removing each in a scratch copy: the other two passed in full every time (9/9, 19/19,
14/14 in every combination). It is now the standing rule in `CLAUDE.md` for all future features,
including how to declare a genuine dependency between two of them.

**Three bugfixes** also landed outside the numbering: the School free-rank reload bug, the Spell
Slots tab visibility race, and the scroll-to-top button that shipped broken.

## Keeping this current

Re-export it by asking Claude to refresh the ledger — it reads the tick state from the artifact
and regenerates this file. Or tick the boxes here by hand: they are ordinary GitHub task-list
checkboxes and editing the file is enough.

`BUILD-LEDGER.html` beside this file is the source of the published artifact. GitHub will show it
as source rather than rendering it — open it locally, or use the artifact link at the top. Its
tick-boxes only persist inside the artifact runtime, so a local copy behaves as a static page.
